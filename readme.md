# VTK Data Visualization

# Requirements

Write an interactive VTK program to explore the iso-surfaces of a volume data set. The user will be able to interactively dene the iso-value using a slider (VTK Slider Widget). Your program will display the corresponding iso-surfaces interactively, and allows the user to examine each isosurface using the VTK interactor. Your program needs to be tested on the following three data sets:

1. The CT Head in Volume16 data format (attached in data folder).

2. An Iron Protein dataset in vtk format (attached in data folder).

3. A $100^3$ sampling data set of the quadratic function $x^2+ 0.5y^2 + 0.2z^2 + 0.1xz + 0.2x$

## Environment install command-
```
conda env remove -n offline3 -y
conda env update --file environment.yml
```
